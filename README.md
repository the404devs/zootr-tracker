A tracker application for Ocarina of Time Randomizer

### *0.2.2 (02/17/19)*
----------------------
I'm back on the grind with this thing again!
Here's what's been changed:
- Slight UI improvements
	- New checkboxes, radio buttons
	- Added text to header
	- Slight change to checklist format
	- Altered Inventory layout
	- Left-side tabs are a bit larger
	- Settings tab will now be a modal dialog (0.2.3)
	- Gave default buttons some CSS love. They still need some more, though.
	- When viewing a map of a dungeon, the map's title will now show the current floor
		- Ex: Forest Temple (2F)
- Finished up putting Fire Temple checks on the map
- Fixed rooms missing from Fire Temple 3F
- Removal of obsolete tab-switching code, now that only the left-hand tabs are present.
